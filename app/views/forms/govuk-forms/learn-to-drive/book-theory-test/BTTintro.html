  Please note:
</h2>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>you can only do the car booking (booking for a motorcyle is very similar so not done here)</li>
  <li>you cannot chose a centre: whatever postcode you enter, ii will only show you 2 centres and always assumed you picked the Glasgow one</li>
  <li>you cannot chose a date or chose a time, it's too much work to reproduce</li>
  <li>the support options have been simplified</li>
  <li>you cannot proceed to the payment page - we didn't have access to these pages so could not reproduce</li>
  <li>there is no validation: if you forget to add some required field for example, the form will still let you through</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-s">
  At any time, selecting the logo at the top left will take you back to the start (forms menu)
