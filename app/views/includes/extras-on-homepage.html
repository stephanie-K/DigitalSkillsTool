            CAPTCHA
          </h3>
          <p>Some forms will sometime ask you to prove that you are <strong>'not a robot'</strong>. You can try by using the form below. Don't worry, this is not a real form. On the form you will need to:</p>
          <p>Check the box:</p>
          <p><image src="{{ asset_path }}images/captcha.png?0.18.3p" alt="screenshot of the captcha part of a form" style="max-width: 100%" ></image></p>
          <p>You will see instrutions and pictures to select.</p>
          <p>If you answer correctly, at the end you will see a green tick in the box, like on the image below:</p>
          <p><image src="{{ asset_path }}images/captcha2.png?0.18.3p" alt="screenshot of the captcha part of a form" style="max-width: 100%" ></image></p>
          <p><a href="https://google.com/recaptcha/api2/demo" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Go to the form and try a CAPTCHA</strong></a> (This will open in another tab and takes you away from this website).</p>

            Entering a date
          </h3>
          <p>In some forms to enter a date, it might look like a calendar you need to navigate to find the right date.</p>
          <p>You can practice in the field below.</p>
          <p>It will look different on a mobile, a table or a laptop.</p>
          <label class="govuk-label govuk-!-font-weight-bold" for="DOB-training">Try to enter your date of birth or any other date:</span></label>
          <input class="govuk-input govuk-!-width-one-third" id="DOB-training" name="DOB-training" type="date" >
