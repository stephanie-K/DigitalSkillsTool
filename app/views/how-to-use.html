        How to use this website
      </h1>
      <a class=" button-secondary govuk-button" href="/">Back to the forms menu</a>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Going back to forms menu</h2>      
    <p>You can go back to the homepage where you can find the forms menu at any time by clicking or tapping on the logo at the top left or by selecting <strong>Home</strong> in the footer.</p>
    <p>Note that <strong>the top left logo will be different on some forms </strong>but it will still take you back on the homepage.</p>
   
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Using a form</h2>
    <p>You can select a form from the menu on the Homepage. It will take you to an <strong>introduction page</strong>. We will tell you what is different from the real form and will inform you if the form is not finished yet.</p>
    <p>The form will be different from the real one. We have simplified it.</p>
    <p>On some pages, you will see a <strong>blue box with some explanations below the form</strong>. They are not part of the real form. They were added to give you a bit more information about how we have changed the form.</p>
    <div class="student-notes-box">
        <p>This is an example of explanation box</p>
    </div>
    <p>Please note that <strong>the real live form might have changed since we reproduced it here</strong>. A lot of these services are constantly improved.</p>
    <p>Please contact us if you notice something is wrong.</p>
    
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Clear the prototype data</h2>  
    <p>Anything you enter in the form is not sent anywhere but it will be 'memorised' during the session.</p>
    <p>You should clear the data when a different person is using the same device (phone or computer). To do this, follow the link '<strong>Clear prototype data</strong>' in the footer.</p>
    <p><strong>You might also want to clear the browser cache</strong> if you are not using your own device: some of the data you have entered during the session might still appear in the autocomplete functionality of your browser (Internet Explorer, Chrome, Safari for example).</p>
    <p>If you are not sure how to do this, you can <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-clear-cache-2617980" target="_blank" rel="noopener">read this article explaining how to clear the cache of your browser</a></p>
