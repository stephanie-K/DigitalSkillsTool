      <p><a href="https://www.eastrenfrewshire.gov.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>East Renfrewshire Council</strong></a> has developed this innovative project to enhance people’s digital skills. Having good digital skills is becoming more necessary during Covid-19 as most organisations are promoting their online services and everything is done remotely.</p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Aim:</h2>
      <p>Tackling digital isolation and enhancing independence by increasing individuals’ confidence in using online services.</p>
      <p>Please see BBC article at the bottom of this page for Digital Isolation definition</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Objectives:</h2>
      <p>To equip learners with the skills and the confidence required to complete online applications, pay for online services, complete online request forms and manage online accounts such as: Universal Credit, Council tax account, etc.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">How?</h2>
      <p>We have recreated forms of exisiting services. They are very similar to the real forms but are simplified and will allow you to practise in a safe way. The forms work on mobiles as well.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Digital isolation: The vulnerable people left behind</h3>
      <p><strong>There is about 1 in 7 people in Scotland who can’t get online (that’s about 800,000 people)</strong></p>
      <p>Source: <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/scotlands-people-annual-report-results-2018-scottish-household-survey/pages/7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scottish household survey 2018: annual report</a></p>
      <br>
      <p><em>"Digital isolation is when people find themselves in a position where they can't access the internet or digital media and devices as much as other people", explains Bibi Reisdorf, an assistant professor in communication studies at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.
      <br><br>
      "In theory, everyone can access the internet, maybe at a library, community centre or at a friend's house, but there are different levels of access."
      <br><br>
      "Digital isolation is "surprisingly prevalent", according to Dr Reisdorf, with western countries seeing a rise in "mobile dependence". That doesn't mean people who are addicted to their mobile phones, it's when your mobile is your only access to the internet.</em></p>
