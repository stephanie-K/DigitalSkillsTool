  <p>We're sorry, you cannot apply online. This is because our online form is unable to do some tasks yet, such as take the details of people who want to apply:</p>

  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>because they're an appointee</li>
      <li>for a young parent who's under the age of 18</li>
      <li>because they've given birth to twins or triplets and one baby died</li>
  </ul>

  <p>You can still apply over the phone or by filling in a paper form.</p>
  <p>Call Social Security Scotland freephone on 0800 182 2222 to work out the best way to apply.</p>
