  <li>there is a different form to train to create your account </li>
  <li>here, we assume you have already created an account and you are starting your claim</li>
  <li>we could not apply for 'real' so we have only re-created the screens we could see</li>
  <li>we didn't add any error messages for all the screens once you've reached the tasks ; we might add them later</li>
  <li>on the real form, you would be stopped if you don't enter the correct information</li>
